# Statistical Analysis Projects - ISI Kolkata

Welcome to the **Statistical Analysis** repository! ðŸŒŸ This repository was created as part of the **Econometrics Application 2** course at ISI Kolkata, under the esteemed guidance of **Prof. Nachiketa Chattopadhyay**. It houses insightful statistical analysis projects that employ advanced methodologies to explore various datasets and draw meaningful inferences.

## Repository Content

### 1. **NC Assignment Kerala.ipynb**
   - **Overview**: This notebook delves into the BMI of children in Kerala. It investigates:
     - The impact of various food habits on BMI.
     - Causal inferences derived from the analysis.
   - **Objective**: To uncover patterns and relationships influencing child health in Kerala.

### 2. **NC Assignment Pareto.ipynb**
   - **Overview**: This notebook explores the **Pareto Distribution** through:
     - Parametric and non-parametric approaches.
     - Monte Carlo simulations via transformation from Uniform distibution pseudo random samples.
   - **Objective**: To demonstrate random sample generation and its applications.

### 3. **NC_Eco_App_2.ipynb**
   - **Overview**: Focuses on the conversion of pseudo-random samples (drawn from uniform distributions) into various other distributions using:
     - Parametric methods.
     - Non-parametric approaches.
   - **Objective**: To explore the flexibility of pseudo-random sample conversion techniques.
